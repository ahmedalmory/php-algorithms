## General Information

The PHP Algorithms Repository is a collection of various algorithms implemented in PHP. The goal of this repository is to provide developers with a resource for learning and practicing algorithms in PHP. 

The algorithms in this repository cover a wide range of topics including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, string algorithms, and many more. Each algorithm is implemented in PHP and includes a brief description of the algorithm, its time and space complexity, and a sample usage.

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, you will need to have PHP installed on your machine. You can download PHP from the official website: [php.net](https://www.php.net/).

Once you have PHP installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/ahmedalmory/php-algorithms.git```

## Usage

Each algorithm in this repository is implemented as a PHP script and can be run from the command line. For example, to run the minimum number swaps required sort array algorithm, run the following command:

```php minimum-number-swaps-required-sort-array.php```


This will execute the script and output the results to the console.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an algorithm you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Implement the algorithm in PHP and add a brief description of the algorithm, its time and space complexity, and a sample usage directly in the PHP file
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added my new algorithm'`)
4. Push to your forked repository
5. Create a new pull request
